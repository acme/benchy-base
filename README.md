Many people use the [3DBenchy 3D model](https://www.3dbenchy.com/) as a way to calibrate a 3D printer or test a new filament.

If you end up with a number of benchies, you might want to organise or display them.

This model is carefully designed to display six benchies. It requires little filament and prints quickly without supports.
